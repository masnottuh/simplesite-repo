# simplesite-repo
demo of knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, first principles
source code is maintained and available at https://github.com/masnottuh/simplesite-repo

this site is built to be a web-based recreation of the familiar kids game "Mad-libs". for copyright reasons I will name it "WordBoard"

the site uses some pre-built stories from the internet with blanks added where certain words go.

The site prompts the user for inputs correlating to categories:
adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and plural nouns

the user input is cycled through using event listeners, and input is stored in objects. Once all input is collected, a boolean is switched and the story is displayed to the user. The data will remain displayed under a refresh. Users then can click the "Try Again" button to complete a new story.
